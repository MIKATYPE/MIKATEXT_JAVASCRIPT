" Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies,",
"with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was",
"the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber",
"to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There",
"were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room;",
"and this room contained rusty looking cooking stove, a",
"cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs,",
"and the beds."

"不思議の国のアリス",
" Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her",
"sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or",
"twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading,",
"but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \"and what",
"is the use of a book,\" thought Alice, \"without pictures or",
"conversation?\""

" One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had",
"nothing to do with it:-it was the black kitten's fault",
"entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face",
"washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and",
"bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it",
"couldn't have had any hand in the mischief."

" \"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\"",

"at her old dress.",
" \"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty",
"of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all,\" added",
"little Amy, with an injured sniff.",
" \"We've got father and mother and each other,\" said Beth,",

"足長おじさん",
" The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful",
"Day-a day to be awaited with dread, endured with courage,",
"and forgotten with haste. Every floor must be spotless,",
"every chair dustless, and every bed without a wrinkle.",
"Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be scrubbed and",
"combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and",
"all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to",
"say \"Yes, sir,\" \"No, sir,\" whenever a trustee spoke."

"幸福な王子",
" High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue",
"of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over with thin",
"leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires,",
"and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt.",
" He was very much admired indeed. \"He is as beautiful as",
"a weathercock,\" remarked one of the Town Councillors who",
"wished to gain a reputation for having artistic tastes;",
"\"only not quite so useful,\" he added, fearing lest people",
"should think him unpractical, which he really was not."
